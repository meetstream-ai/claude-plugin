# AGENTS.md

Guidance for AI coding agents working in this repository. This repo is the **MeetStream plugin for Claude Code** - the MCP server plus skills, distributed through the Claude Code marketplace.

## Always use the MeetStream MCP

When building anything against the MeetStream API, install and use the MeetStream MCP. It is the current source of truth for endpoints, request and response fields, webhook events, provider names and bot behaviour.

Do not treat the files in this repository as authoritative for MeetStream API behaviour. They can lag the API. If local code and the MCP disagree, the MCP wins unless the user says otherwise.

Server name: `meetstream`. Hosted URL: `https://mcp.meetstream.ai/mcp`.

### Claude Code

```sh
claude mcp add --transport http meetstream https://mcp.meetstream.ai/mcp \
  --header "Authorization: Bearer $MEETSTREAM_API_KEY"
```

The [MeetStream Claude plugin](https://github.com/meetstream-ai/claude-plugin) is a separate, complementary install. It ships **skills only** and does not include the MCP server, so install both:

```sh
/plugin marketplace add meetstream-ai/claude-plugin
```

### Cursor

Add to `~/.cursor/mcp.json`, or install the [MeetStream Cursor plugin](https://github.com/meetstream-ai/meetstream-cursor-plugin):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "meetstream": {
      "url": "https://mcp.meetstream.ai/mcp",
      "headers": { "Authorization": "Bearer YOUR_MEETSTREAM_API_KEY" }
    }
  }
}
```

### Windsurf

Add to `~/.codeium/windsurf/mcp_config.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "meetstream": {
      "serverUrl": "https://mcp.meetstream.ai/mcp",
      "headers": { "Authorization": "Bearer YOUR_MEETSTREAM_API_KEY" }
    }
  }
}
```

### Claude Desktop

Settings -> Connectors -> Add custom connector. Name it `meetstream`, URL `https://mcp.meetstream.ai/mcp`.

### Codex

```sh
codex mcp add meetstream --url https://mcp.meetstream.ai/mcp \
  --header "Authorization: Bearer $MEETSTREAM_API_KEY"
```

### Run it locally instead

```sh
MEETSTREAM_API_KEY=ms_... npx -y @meetstream/mcp
```

### Use the MCP before

- calling any MeetStream endpoint
- changing webhook handling or event names
- adding or changing bot, transcription, calendar or MIA behaviour
- relying on any request field, response field, provider name or status code

## Working in this repo

There is no build and no test runner. The plugin is declarative: JSON manifests plus Markdown skills.

```
.claude-plugin/plugin.json       plugin manifest (name, version, mcpServers, skills)
.claude-plugin/marketplace.json  marketplace entry
skills/<name>/SKILL.md           one skill per directory
agents/                          bundled agents
CHANGELOG.md                     user-visible history
```

### Testing a change locally

```sh
/plugin marketplace add /absolute/path/to/this/repo
```

Install from the local path, restart Claude Code, then confirm with `/mcp` that the server connected and ask for `list_bots`.

### Skill rules

- A skill lives at `skills/<name>/SKILL.md` and its YAML frontmatter `name:` **must match the directory name** exactly.
- The `description:` is what triggers loading. Write the phrases a user would actually say, not a summary of the file.
- Every link must resolve. Dead documentation links in a shipped skill are worse than no link.
- Do not describe an MCP tool that does not exist. MIA agent configs, calendar connection, Google signed-in bots, Zoom OAuth, storage config and pause/resume are **REST-only** - route to REST rather than implying a tool.

### Releasing

Bump `version` in `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`, add a `CHANGELOG.md` entry, then commit. Users pull the new version through the marketplace, so a version that does not change is a version nobody receives.

## API rules that are easy to get wrong

These are live-verified. Do not "fix" code that follows them.

- **Auth differs by surface.** The REST API at `api.meetstream.ai` uses `Authorization: Token <key>`. The MCP server at `mcp.meetstream.ai` uses `Authorization: Bearer <key>`. Mixing them up returns 401.
- The webhook envelope key is **`event`**, not `bot_event`.
- **`bot.stopped` is the single terminal event** and always carries `status_code: 200`. The reason lives in `bot_status`: `Stopped`, `NotAllowed` (waiting-room timeout), `Denied` (host refused), `Error`.
- `bot.error` is **non-terminal** - the bot keeps running.
- **Streaming-only providers never emit `bot.done`.** They end at `audio.processed`, and a post-call transcript fetch returns `202` forever, so any polling loop needs a cap.
- Transcripts are fetched by **`transcript_id`**, not `bot_id`, and segments use **`transcript`**, not `text`.
- **`202` and `507` are not errors.** 202 means poll again; 507 means an idempotent retry replayed and is a success.
- The bot field is **`meeting_link`**, not `meeting_url`.
- `in_call_recording_timeout` has a hard floor of **600 seconds**; below it the API returns 400.
- MIA bots take **only `agent_config_id`**. Adding `socket_connection_url` or `live_audio_required` alongside it is the usual cause of a silent agent.

## Security

- Never hard-code or commit a key. `ms_...` values belong in the environment.
- Never log a key, a transcript, or participant data.
- Do not expose a server-side key to client code.
- Verify webhook signatures before acting on a payload.
- Do not persist meeting, transcript, participant or recording data unless asked.

## Before you finish

- Every skill's frontmatter `name` matches its directory.
- Every link resolves.
- `plugin.json` and `marketplace.json` are valid JSON.
- Version bumped and `CHANGELOG.md` updated when behaviour changed.
- State which MCP tools or docs you relied on, what changed, and what you did not verify.
